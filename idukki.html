                    <p><br>The south-west state of India, Kerala is one of the major tourist destinations in the country with its silvery coast, serpentine backwaters, coconut grove swaying to the south-west wind and Western Ghats covered in aromatic spice and tea plantation. There is no dearth of places to see in Kerala and Munnar is one such place. Located at about 5,200 ft above the sea level, Munnar is a beautiful hill station in the district of Idukki, Kerala. Once the summer resort for the British, Munnar is known for its pleasant climate and pristine beauty. The rolling hills covered in mist intersected by the winding road, the dark emerald green coloured plantation and the few lone houses in midst of it will instantly make you fall in love with this place. Munnar is a very popular destination among the honeymooners. It is also an ideal place for nature lovers, wildlife lovers and adventure enthusiasts alike. You can indulge in boating, trekking and paragliding. Munnar is the perfect place to hang your shoes and just soak in the calm and relaxing atmosphere. <br><br>
                        Munnar got its name from the word Moonu Aaru, which means ‘three rivers’ in Malayalam. The hill station is situated at the confluence of Kundaly, Nallathanni and Madhurapuzha. This place offers you a refreshing break from the humid climate of the coastal part of the state. The ethereal beauty of the scenic valley, rolling hills, virgin forest and waterfalls will enchant you. Munnar is one of the places in India with rich biodiversity. There are two parts of Munnar, the Old Munnar and Munnar. You will find most of the hotels and guest houses in Munnar and the tourist information office in Old Munnar.</p>
                        
                    <h4 style="color: chocolate;">2.Meeshapulimala</h4><br>
                    <img src="./images/MEESAPULIMALA4.jpg" alt="" style="height: 500px;width: 700px;margin-left: px;">
                    <p><br>Perched at a height of 2640 meters above the sea level, Meesapulimala is the second highest peak when it comes to the mountain ranges in the Western Ghat. This mountain range is a trekker’s paradise in the Southern parts of India, and is located just a small distance away from the beautiful Munnar town of Idukki district in Kerala. The name of the peak is derived from the fact that it is made of a total of eight peaks. All of these mountains are spread out and have a moustache like formation. The mountain range is sandwiched between Anaimalai Hills and the Palani Hills, which are located near Suryanelli. <br><br>

                        The beauty of the mountain range can only be fully appreciated if you trek to the top of the mountain. To that end, first, you have to take a jeep to the base camp and then hike to the top of the mountain. However, this route should only be undertaken by veteran hiking enthusiasts, as it can be quite grueling. Most of the travelers prefer to undertake an easier trek from Rhodovalley to Meesapulimala, which is 8 km long. You can also hike to the mountains from Silent Valley, which is located 6 km away from Rhodo Valley. <br><br>
                        
                        Regardless of what trail you take, the mesmerizing views of the grasslands, emerald green rainforests and the rich wildlife of the region is sure to take your breath away. The trek covers 8 hills on the border of Kerala, and offers you some of the most stunning views of the region. <br><br>
                        
                        Moreover, Meesapulimala has also been declared as a world heritage site by UNESCO, so it is definitely worth checking out. This small town is located just 20 km from Munnar, and also oversees the beautiful Kolukkumalai tea estate. You can also visit other tourist attractions like Tea Station and Tripadamala when you are here, as both of these places are quite close to Meesapulimala.</p>
